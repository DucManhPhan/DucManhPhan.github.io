## Given problem






<br>

## Solution of Two pointer technique






<br>

## When to use

- When we have to deal with sorted arrays (or Linked List) and need to find a set of elements that fulfill cretain constraints.

    The set of elements could be a pair, a triplet, or even a subarray.



<br>

## Wrapping up

- Due to our context of this technique is the sorted array or something, so we can use binary search as the brute-force solution when we do not think other solutions.
