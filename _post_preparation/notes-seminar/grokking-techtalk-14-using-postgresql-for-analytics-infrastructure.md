## The difference between Transactional Applications and Analytics Applications

1. Data

    |           Transactional Applications             |           Analytics Applications           |
    | ------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------ |
    | Many single-row writes                           | Few large batch imports                    |
    | Current, single data                             | Years of data, many resources              |


2. Queries

    |           Transactional Applications             |           Analytics Applications           |
    | ------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------ |
    | Generated by user activities; 10 to 1000 users   | Generated by large imports; 1 to 10 users  |
    | < 1s response time                               | Queries run for hours                      |
    | Short queries                                    | Long queries                               |

## Why start with PostgreSQL

![](../../img/analytics-db/states-db.png)

In our analytic applications, our data will have three states:
1. Start
2. Grow
3. Scale

    At this stage, we normally use the other database


Belows are some reasons that we use PostgreSQL for this problem.
- Simple to get started

- Rich features for analytics

    - Data Pipeline (ETL)
    - Data Analysis

    To understand where Data Pipeline or Data Analysis will be used, we need to look at the below image.

- Scale up
