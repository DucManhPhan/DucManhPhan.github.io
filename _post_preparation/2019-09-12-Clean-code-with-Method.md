## What (not) to Return




<br>

## Method parameters


We need to notice about the number of arguments, because when we have multiple arguments, it always makes us remember them.

It is really difficult when business logic of method is complicated. So, below is an image to describe the recommended number of argument.

|        OK        |          Avoid             |          Refactor         |
| ---------------- | -------------------------- | ------------------------- |
|     0 - 2        |             3              |            4 +            |
