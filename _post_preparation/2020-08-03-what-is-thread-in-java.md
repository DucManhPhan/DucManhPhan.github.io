## Given problem






<br>

## Solution with using threads





1. Threads that are managed by JVM




    Priority of a thread:
    - The priorities of threads in Java starts from 1 - the lowest priority to 10 - the highest priority.
    - At the construction time of a thread, by default, its priority is 5.
    - When setting for a thread's priority, we can use some enumerations such as Thread.MIN_PRIORITY, Thread.MAX_PRIORITY, Thread.MEDIUM_PRIORITY. 

2. Threads that are managed by Kernel

    Below is the structure of TCB - Thread Control Block.
