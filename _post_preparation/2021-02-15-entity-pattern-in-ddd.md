## Given problem






<br>

## Solution of Entity pattern







<br>

## Some types of equality

There are three types of equality.
1. Reference equality

    ![](../img/Architecture-pattern/Domain-driven-design/entity-pattern/reference-equality.png)

    Reference equality means that two objects are deemed to be equal if they reference the same address in the memory.

2. Identifier equality

    ![](../img/Architecture-pattern/Domain-driven-design/entity-pattern/identifier-equality.png)

    Identifier equality implies a class has an ID field. Two instances of such a class would be equal if they have the same idenfifiers.

3. Structural equality

    ![](../img/Architecture-pattern/Domain-driven-design/entity-pattern/structural-equality.png)

    Structural equality means that there are two objects equal if all of their members match.
