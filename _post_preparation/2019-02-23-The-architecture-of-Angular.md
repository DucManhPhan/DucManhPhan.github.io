Before, we has only one version that is AngularJs, or Angular 1.x. The architecture of AngularJS is very different with the version of Angular at the moment. Because AngularJS is utilizing MVC architecture pattern, then, Angular 2.x or above uses MVVM pattern, Dependency Injection, ...

Angular 2.x is a platform and framework for building client applications in HTML and Typescript. Angular is written in Typescript. It implements core and optional functionality as a set of Typescript libraries that we import into our apps.

So, in this article, we will discuss about the architecture of Angular 2.x, some parts in this framework.

To understand about the architecture of Angular, we will see the below image:

So, we can conclude that there are eight main building blocks
1. Module
2. Component
3. Metadata
4. Template
5. Data Binding
6. Service
7. Directive
8. Dependency Injection

## 1. Module
Module is the block of code which is designed to perform a single task.

## 2. Component




<br>

## 3. Metadata



<br>

## 4. Template



<br>

## 5. Data Binding
