## Given problem

Given a binary tree, return the level order traversal of its node's value.

![](../img/Data-structure/binary-tree/traversal/sample-binary-tree.png)

The output of the above binary tree is:

```java
1 --> 2 --> 3 --> 4 --> 5 --> 6 --> 7
```

## Using recursive version

Belows are some steps that we use.
1. The first action we need to do is to calculate the maximum level of the tree.

2. After we had the tree's maximum level, we will iterate from level 1 to the maximum level, then get all elements of each level.

```java

```
