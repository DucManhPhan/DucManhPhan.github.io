## Definition of MVVM Pattern
According to [wikipedia.com](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93presenter), we have the definition of MVP pattern:

```
MVP pattern is a derivation of the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural pattern, and is used mostly for building user interfaces.

In MVP, the presenter assumes the functionality of the middle-man.

In MVP, all presetation logic is pushed to the presenter.
```

And MVP pattern originated in the early 1990s at Taligent, a joint venture of Apple, IBM, and Hewlett-Packard.
