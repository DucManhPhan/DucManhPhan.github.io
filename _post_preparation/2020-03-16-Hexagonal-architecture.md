## Problem of Layered architecture






<br>

## Solution of Hexagonal architecture






<br>

## History of Hexagonal

The hexagonal architecture was invented by ```Alistair Cockburn``` in an attempt to avoid known structural pitfalls in object-oriented software design, such as undesired dependencies between layers and contamination of user interface code with business logic, and published in **2005**.

## Ports and Adapters
1. Ports

    Ports form the outer layer of the architecture. They acts as an interface, an API to all the external requests. They prevent any external request to have any sort of direct interaction with an application resource.
