## Solution with Data types

MySQL has some data types:

|          Data Type           |         Spec        |          Data Type        |        Spec         |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------- | ------------------------- | ------------------- |
| CHAR                         | String (0 - 2^8 - 1) | INT                       | Use 4 bytes with signed int range value: -2^31 to 2^31 - 1 or unsigned int range value: 0 to 2^32 - 1 |
| VARCHAR                      | String (0 - 2^8 - 1) | BIGINT                    | Use 8 bytes with signed bigint range value: -2^63 to 2^63 - 1 or unsigned bigint range value: 0 to 2^64 - 1 |
| TINYTEXT                     | String (0 - 2^8 - 1) | FLOAT                     | Use 4 bytes with precision from 0 to 23 results |
| TEXT                         | String (0 - 2^16 - 1)| DOUBLE                    | Use 8 bytes with precision from 24 to 53 results |
| BLOB                         | String (0 - 2^16 - 1)| DECIMAL                   | "DOUBLE" stored as string |
| MEDIUMTEXT                   | String (0 - 2^24 - 1)| DATE                    | YYYY-MM-DD           | 
| MEDIUMBLOB                   | String (0 - 2^24 - 1)| DATETIME                | YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS  | 
| LONGTEXT                     | String (0 - 2^32 - 1)| TIMESTAMP               | YYYYMMDDHHMMSS       | 
| LONGBLOB                     | String (0 - 2^32 - 1)| TIME                    | HH:MM:SS             |
| TINYINT                      | Use 1 byte with signed tiny int range value: -2^7 to 2^7 - 1 or unsigned tiny int range value: 0 to 2^8 - 1 | ENUM | One of preset options |
| SMALLINT                     | Use 2 bytes with signed small int range value: -2^15 to 2^15 -1 or unsigned small int range value: 0 to 2^16 -1 | SET | Selection of preset options |
| MEDIUMINT                    | Use 3 bytes with signed medium int range value: -2^23 to 2^23 - 1 or unsigned medium int range value: 0 to 2^24 - 1 | BOOLEAN | TINYINT(1) |

In MySQL, an ENUM is a string object whose value is chosen from a list of permitted values defined at the time of column creation. MySQL ENUM uses numeric indexes (1, 2, 3, â€¦) to represents string values.

So, to optimize our schema with data types, we need to choose the suitable data types for our values. Belows are some rules for this case:
- Smaller is usually better

    For example, our variable's value is only from 0 to 24. Then, we can use TINYINT for this variable's value. We should avoid use SMALLINT, MEDIUMINT, or event INT. Because TINYINT takes 1 bytes in memory, but SMALLINT - 2 bytes, MEDIUMINT - 3 bytes, and INT - 4 bytes.

    **For storage and computational purposes, INT(1) is identical to INT(20).**

- Simple is good

    Fewer CPU cycles are typically required to process operations on simpler data types.

    For example:
    - integers are cheaper to compare than characters, because character sets and collations (sorting rules) makes comparisons complicated.
    - stores date, time in MySQL's builtin types instead of as strings.
    - use integers for IP address.

## Solution with Default value

Normally, we do not use **NOT NULL** condition to apply for multiple fields in tables. Using that way has some drawbacks that we need to know:
- When we create a table, MySQL will automatically build a B+ Tree index to opmitize queries. But if the specific field has multiple values that are NULL. It's difficult for MySQL to make indexes. Even if B+ Tree index is created, the traversal of this tree is hard, because MySQL will do some special operations to compare values.

- When a nullable column is indexed, it requires an extra byte per entry and can even cause a fixed-size index (such as an index on a single integer column) to be converted to a variable-sized one in MyISAM.

- InnoDB stores NULL with a single bit, so it can be pretty space-efficient for sparsely populated data. This doesn't apply to MyISAM, though.

So, to avoid the NULL value, we can use default value or set that column to **NOT NULL**.

## Solution with String data type

Since MySQL 4.1, each string column can have its own character set and set of sorting rules for that character set, or collation.

1. VARCHAR and CHAR type

    The implementation of these types are storage engine-dependent. So, we will concentrate largely on the InnoDB storage engine or MyISAM.

    - VARCHAR

        VARCHAR stores variable-length character strings and is the most common string data type. It can require less storage space than fixed-length types, because it uses only as much space as it needs. The exception is a MyISAM table created with ROW_FORMAT=FIXED, which uses a fixed amount of space on disk for each row and can thus waste space.

        VARCHAR uses 1 or 2 extra bytes to record the value's length:
        - 1 byte if the column's maximum length is 255 bytes or less
        - 2 byte if it's more.

        VARCHAR helps performance because it saves space. However, because the rows are variable-length, they can grow when we update them, which can cause extra work. If a row grows and no longer fits in its orginal location, the behavior is storage engine-dependent.

        For example, MyISAM may fragment the row, and InnoDB may need to split the page to fit the row into it. Other engines may never update data in-place at all.

        It's usually worth using VARCHAR when the maximum column length is much larger than the average length.
        - when updates to the fields are rare, so fragmentation is not a problem
        - when we're using a complex character set such as UTF-8, where each character uses a variable number of bytes of storage.

        In version 5.0 and newer, MySQL preserves **trailing spaces** when we store and retrieve values. In versions 4.1 and older, MySQL strips trailing spaces.

        It's trickier with InnoDB, which can store long VARCHAR values as BLOBs.

    - CHAR

        CHAR is fixed-length. MySQL always allocates enough space for the specified number of characters. When storing a CHAR value, MySQL removes any trailing spaces. This was also true of VARCHAR in MySQL 4.1 and older versions - CHAR and VARCHAR were logically identical and differed only in storage format. Values are padded with spaces as needed for comparisons.

        CHAR is useful if we want to store very short strings, or if all the values are nearly the same length. For example, CHAR is a good choice for MD5 values for user passwords, which are always the same length.

        CHAR is also better than VARCHAR for data that's changed frequently, because a fixed-length row is not prone to fragmentation.

        For very short columns, CHAR is also more efficient than VARCHAR.

        For example:
        - a CHAR(1) designed to hold only Y and N values will use only one byte in a single-byte character set.
        - a VARCHAR(1) would use two bytes because of the length byte.
