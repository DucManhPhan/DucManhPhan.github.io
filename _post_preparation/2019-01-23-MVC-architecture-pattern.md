# Definition of MVC Pattern
According to MVC pattern in [wikipedia.com](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93controller), we have the definition of it:

```
Model-View-Controller (usually known as MVC) is an architectural pattern commonly used for user interfaces that divides an application into three interconnected parts. This is done to separate internal representations of information from the ways information is presented to and accepted from the user. The MVC design pattern decouples these major components allowing for code reuse and parallel development.
```

Model - The central of the pattern. It is the application's dynamic data structure, independent of the user interface. It directly manages the data, logic and rules of the application.

View - Any representation of information such a chart, diagram or table. Multiple views of the same information are possible, such as a bar chart for management and a tabular view for accountants.
