## Definition of Abstract factory Pattern



<br>

## When to use



<br>

## Benefits & Drawback
1. Benefits
- Loose coupling in which object creation can be independent of the class implementation.
- The client need not be aware of the class that creates the object which, in turn, is utilized by the client. It is only necessary to know the interface, methods and parameters that need to be passed to know the interface, methods, and parameters that need to be passed to create objects of the desired type. This simplifies implementations for the client.
- Adding another class to the factory to create objects of another type can be easily done without the client changing the code. At a minimum, the client needs to pass just another parameter.
- The factory can also reuse the existing objects. However, when the client does direct object creation, this always creates a new object.
