## Inverse words in a sentence

This is the easiest way to implement our problem, because we do not need to utilize the advanced words, or add, remove the type of words. We only change the position of the words in a sentence.

For example:

- People eat more food produced in other regions than local food.
    
    --> The consumption of imported food has gained popularity in recent years.

    imported food = food produced in other regions

    eating food = consumption

- Violent crime is on the rise among teenagers.

    --> Violent offences are rising among teenagers.

    offence /ə'fens/ = crime /kraim/

## Use the synonyms or antonyms

For example:

- My car needs petrol.

    --> My vehicle requires fuel.

    car = vehicle
    petrol = fuel

- When managers motivate employees to work together, they feel more obligated to stay with the company.

    --> Staff are less likely to change jobs if cooperation is encouraged.

    less likely to change jobs: ít có khả năng đổi việc

    obligate /'ɑblɪgeɪt/ = compel /kəm'pel/ = force /meɪk/ = require /rɪ'kwaɪə(r)/


<br>

## Convert to passive voice and vice versa

For example:

- People say that global warming is caused by the burning of fossil fuels.

    --> Global warming is said to be caused by the burning of fossil fuels.


<br>

## Use the other word forms

For example:

- Education is obviously a much better measure for raising awareness of laws.

    --> People who are properly educated have stronger heightened awareness of laws.

    heighten /'haɪtn/ (v): become more extrem


<br>

## Use the enumerative way

For example:

- Advertising is all around us.

    --> Pop-ups, flyers and billboards are virtually everywhere.



<br>

## Use the dummy subject

For example:

- Children should obey the rules their parents and teachers set

    --> It is claimed that offspring should follow all the rules their parents and teachers set.

    offspring (n): the immediate descendants of a person
