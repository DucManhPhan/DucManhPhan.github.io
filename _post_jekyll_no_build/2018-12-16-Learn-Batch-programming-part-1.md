Before, I think that using batch programming is something that is not needed for me. But now, I have to rethink about it. Because using batch programming makes me relax when I usually encounter the tasks about automatically running test command. 

The below things you will learn some commands that need to do with automatically tasks.

## If statement

File syntax: 

```
    IF [NOT] EXIST *filename command* 
    IF [NOT] EXIST *filename (command)* ELSE (*command*)
```

String syntax:

```
    IF [/I] [NOT] *item1==item2 command*
    IF [/I] *item1 compareop item2 command*
    IF [/I] *item1 compareop item2 (command)* ELSE (*command*)
```

Use AND conditions:

```
    IF condition_1 
      IF condition_2 (
        Command_if_both_are_true
      )
    )
```

Use OR conditions:

```
    SET "_tempvar="
    IF condition_1 set _tempvar=1
    IF condition_2 set _tempvar=1
    IF %_tempvar% EQU 1 Command_if_either_is_true
```

with: 

  * item : a text string or environment variable, substring (%var:~n, m%), search syntax.

  * filename : a file to test || a wildcard pattern.

  * /I : case Insensitive string comparison.

  * compareop : EQU, NEQ, LSS, LEQ,  GTR, GEQ.

  * == : perform command if the two strings are equal.

Ex: Check whether folder is empty or not.

```
::Check the first passed parameter is null or not
if {%1}=={} set _empty=Syntax: %0 "" &goto :message

::Does folder exist
if not exist %1 (
  set _empty=No Such Folder
  goto :message
)

:: Is folder empty
set _TMP=
for /f "delims=" %%a in ('dir /b %1') do set _TMP=%%a

::Compare null with the path of file
IF {%_TMP%}=={} (
  set _empty=Empty
) ELSE (
  set _empty=Not Empty
)

:message
echo:
Echo %_empty%
```

## For statement with file's content, command, string

Syntax: 
    FOR /F ["options"] %%parameter IN (*filenameset*) DO *command*
    FOR /F ["options"] %%parameter IN ("Text string to process") DO *command*
    FOR /F ["options"] %%parameter IN ('command_to_process') DO *command*

with: 
  - *filenameset* : a set of one or more files.
  - options: 
    - delims=xxx : The delimiter character (default = space)
    - skip=n : a number of lines to skip at the beginning of the file (default = 0)
    - eol=; : character at the start of each line (default = ;)
    - tokens=n : specifies which numbered items to read from each line (default = 1)
    - usebackq : Use double quotes for long file names in "filenameset"; Use single quotes for 'Text string to process'; Use back quotes for 'command to process'

Notice: 
- tokens=2,4,6 will cause the second, fourth and sixth items on each line to be processed.
- tokens=2-6 will cause the second, third, fourth, fifth and sixth items on each line to be processed.
- tokens=* will cause all items on each line to be processed.
- tokens=3* will process the third token and the 4th + all subsequent items, this can also be written as tokens=3,*
- Each token specified will cause a corresponding parameter letter to be allocated. The letters used for tokens are case sensitive.If the last character in the tokens= string is an asterisk, then additional parameters are allocated for all the remaining text on the line.
- If the clause results in a multiple values then extra parameters are implicitly defined to hold each. These are automatically assigned in alphabetical order %%H %%I %%J ...(implicit parameter definition).

Ex: list all the text files in a folder

```
@echo off
FOR /F "tokens=*" %%G IN ('dir /b E:\...\*.txt') DO echo %%G
```


## FOR statement with files

Syntax: 

    FOR %%parameter IN (set) DO command

with: 
  - set : a set of files that is separated by any standard delimiter.

Ex: 

```
::Copy a single file
for %%G in ("C:\doc file\file_1.txt" "C:\doc file\file_2.txt") do copy %%G E:\docs\
```


## FOR statement with range of numbers

Syntax: 

    FOR /L %%parameter IN (start,step,end) DO *command*

with: 
  - start : the first number
  - step : the number to increment
  - end : the last number

Ex: 

```
@echo off 
for /l %g in (1, 2, 10) do echo %g
```


## FOR statement with folders / directories

Syntax: 

    FOR /D [/r] %%parameter IN (*folder_set*) DO *command*

with: 
  - *folder_set* : a set of folders with wildcards: * or ?. Ex: C:\doc\*
  - /r : recusive with subfolders.

Ex: 

```
@ECHO OFF 
FOR /D %%G IN (D:\doc\*) DO @ECHO %%G
```

Notice: In *folder_set*, you can not use the space character in the folder's path. To resolve this problem, you can use the other loop command

## FOR statement with recursive subfolders

Syntax: 

    FOR /R [*[drive:]path*] %%parameter IN (*set*) DO *command*

with:
  - *drive:path*  : The folder tree where the files are located.
  - *set* : a set of files with the obligated wildcards.

Notice: 
- This command walks down the folder tree starting at [drive:]path, and executes the DO statement against each matching file.


Ex: 

Delete every .bak file in every subfolder starting at C:\temp

```
@echo off
For /R C:\temp\ %%G IN (*.bak) do Echo del "%%G"
```
