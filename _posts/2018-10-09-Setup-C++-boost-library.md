Boost contains over 80 libraries for C++ programming language that supports for task and structures such as Linear Algebra, **Image Processing**, **Pseudo random number generation**, multithreading, regular expression and **unit testing**. 

They range from general-purpose libraries like the **smart pointer library**, to **operating system abstractions** like Boost FileSystem, to libraries primarily aimed at other library developers and advanced C++ users, like the **template metaprogramming (MPL)** and **domain-specific language (DSL)** creation (Proto).

Before programming with C++ Boost Library, we have to intend to install the Boost library. The following is the steps to install: 

- Download C++ Boost library in the Internet. 
- Decompress this zip file. 
- In the directory such as boost_1_68_0, run the "bootstrap.bat".
- Finally, run the executable file: "b2".

This image is our result when installing successfully.

We can use the above paths to insert into our project.
